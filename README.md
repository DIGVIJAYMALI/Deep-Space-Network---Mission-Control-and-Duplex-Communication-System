SpaceXYZ is in the business of launching rockets and satellites into space for its customers. The launch vehicle or the "Rocket" and the payload that may be a satellite are two components of each SpaceXYZ spacecraft launch. SpaceXYZ has a Deep Space Network (DSN) facility with a communication system and mission control system from which it launches and interacts with its spacecraft. SpaceXYZ wants to design a software system to run their operations.
